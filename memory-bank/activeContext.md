# Active Context: Storybook Implementation

## Current Focus
Continuing Phase 4 implementation of complex components after completing all Button-related components and organizing them in a shared folder structure.

## Immediate Tasks
1. ✅ **Phase 1**: Plan the implementation approach and create task breakdown
2. ✅ **Phase 2**: Implement stories for high-priority components (Alert, Avatar, Checkbox, etc.)
3. ✅ **Phase 3**: Implement stories for form components (Inputs, Select, Radio, Switch, Button variants)
4. 🚧 **Phase 4**: Implement stories for complex components (Modal, DataTable, Charts, etc.)
5. **Phase 5**: Quality assurance and documentation completion

## Current Decisions
- **Pattern**: Use established story patterns with comprehensive examples
- **Structure**: Each story includes Default, variants, examples, and comprehensive showcases
- **Documentation**: Extract props and examples from existing MDX documentation
- **Approach**: Systematic implementation in phases based on component complexity
- **Organization**: Related components grouped in shared folders (e.g., Button folder)

## Recent Accomplishments
1. ✅ **Button Components Complete**: All Button-related components (Button, ButtonV2, ButtonGroup, ButtonGroupV2) implemented with comprehensive stories
2. ✅ **Folder Organization**: Organized all Button components in `apps/storybook/stories/components/Button/` with proper titles
3. ✅ **Phase 3 Complete**: All form components including Button variants completed
4. ✅ **Quality Standards**: Established comprehensive quality checks for each component type

## Next Steps
1. Continue with Phase 4 complex components
2. Focus on DataTable, Charts, Menu, Dropdown, Popover, Sidebar, Directory, Tabs
3. Maintain established quality standards and comprehensive examples
4. Consider similar folder organization for related component groups

## Resources Available
- ✅ Existing Button.stories.tsx pattern
- ✅ Component MDX documentation in `apps/docs/content/docs/components/`
- ✅ Component meta information and prop tables
- ✅ Working Storybook configuration
- ✅ Component exports available in `blend-v1` package

## Constraints
- Must maintain consistency with existing Button story pattern
- Must extract accurate prop information from documentation
- Must ensure all stories are functional and properly tested
- Must follow TypeScript best practices and proper imports
