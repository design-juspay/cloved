# Active Context: Storybook Implementation

## Current Focus
Planning and implementing Storybook stories for all Blend Design System components following the established Button component pattern.

## Immediate Tasks
1. **Phase 1**: Plan the implementation approach and create task breakdown
2. **Phase 2**: Implement stories for high-priority components (Alert, Text, Avatar, Checkbox, etc.)
3. **Phase 3**: Implement stories for form components (Inputs, Select, Radio, Switch, etc.)
4. **Phase 4**: Implement stories for complex components (Modal, DataTable, Charts, etc.)
5. **Phase 5**: Quality assurance and documentation completion

## Current Decisions
- **Pattern**: Use `Button.stories.tsx` as the template
- **Structure**: Each story will include Default, Playground, and relevant variants
- **Documentation**: Extract props and examples from existing MDX documentation
- **Approach**: Systematic implementation in phases based on component complexity

## Next Steps
1. Create detailed task breakdown for systematic implementation
2. Start with simpler components to establish workflow
3. Focus on components that are likely to be most commonly used
4. Ensure each story is functional and properly documented

## Resources Available
- ✅ Existing Button.stories.tsx pattern
- ✅ Component MDX documentation in `apps/docs/content/docs/components/`
- ✅ Component meta information and prop tables
- ✅ Working Storybook configuration
- ✅ Component exports available in `blend-v1` package

## Constraints
- Must maintain consistency with existing Button story pattern
- Must extract accurate prop information from documentation
- Must ensure all stories are functional and properly tested
- Must follow TypeScript best practices and proper imports
