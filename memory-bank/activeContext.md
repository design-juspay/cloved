# Active Context: Storybook Implementation

## Current Focus
Continuing Phase 4 implementation of complex components. Just completed Charts component with animations disabled for better Storybook experience.

## Immediate Tasks
1. âœ… **Phase 1**: Plan the implementation approach and create task breakdown
2. âœ… **Phase 2**: Implement stories for high-priority components (Alert, Avatar, Checkbox, etc.)
3. âœ… **Phase 3**: Implement stories for form components (Inputs, Select, Radio, Switch, Button variants)
4. ðŸš§ **Phase 4**: Implement stories for complex components (Modal, DataTable, Charts, etc.)
5. **Phase 5**: Quality assurance and documentation completion

## Current Decisions
- **Pattern**: Use established story patterns with comprehensive examples
- **Structure**: Each story includes Default, variants, examples, and comprehensive showcases
- **Documentation**: Extract props and examples from existing MDX documentation
- **Approach**: Systematic implementation in phases based on component complexity
- **Organization**: Related components grouped in shared folders (e.g., Button folder)
- **Animations**: Disabled chart animations in Storybook to prevent distracting left-to-right growing effects

## Recent Accomplishments
1. âœ… **Charts Component Complete**: Implemented comprehensive Charts story with all chart types (Line, Bar, Pie), interactive legends, custom colors, and animations disabled
2. âœ… **Animation Issue Resolved**: Added CSS overrides to disable Recharts animations in Storybook
3. âœ… **Phase 4 Progress**: 3 of 8 complex components completed (Tabs, Popover, Charts)
4. âœ… **Quality Standards Maintained**: Charts story includes 10 comprehensive examples with realistic data

## Next Steps
1. Continue with remaining Phase 4 complex components
2. Focus on DataTable, Menu, Dropdown, Sidebar, Directory
3. Maintain established quality standards and comprehensive examples
4. Consider similar folder organization for related component groups

## Resources Available
- âœ… Existing Button.stories.tsx pattern
- âœ… Component MDX documentation in `apps/docs/content/docs/components/`
- âœ… Component meta information and prop tables
- âœ… Working Storybook configuration
- âœ… Component exports available in `blend-v1` package
- âœ… Charts story as reference for complex data visualization components

## Constraints
- Must maintain consistency with existing Button story pattern
- Must extract accurate prop information from documentation
- Must ensure all stories are functional and properly tested
- Must follow TypeScript best practices and proper imports
- Must consider performance implications (e.g., disabling animations where appropriate)

## Technical Notes
- **Charts Animation Fix**: Added global CSS to disable Recharts animations via `.recharts-*` classes
- **Data Generators**: Created reusable data generator functions for realistic chart examples
- **TypeScript Types**: Properly imported and used ChartType, ChartLegendPosition, NewNestedDataPoint
- **Responsive Design**: All chart examples use responsive containers with proper sizing
