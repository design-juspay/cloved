# Active Context: Storybook Implementation

## Current Focus
Working on both Phase 4 complex components and Phase 5 specialized components. Just completed Tags and SplitTag components, organized in a shared Tags folder.

## Immediate Tasks
1. âœ… **Phase 1**: Plan the implementation approach and create task breakdown
2. âœ… **Phase 2**: Implement stories for high-priority components (Alert, Avatar, Checkbox, etc.)
3. âœ… **Phase 3**: Implement stories for form components (Inputs, Select, Radio, Switch, Button variants)
4. ðŸš§ **Phase 4**: Implement stories for complex components (Modal, DataTable, Charts, etc.)
5. ðŸš§ **Phase 5**: Implement stories for specialized components (Tags, SplitTag, AvatarGroup, etc.)

## Current Decisions
- **Pattern**: Use established story patterns with comprehensive examples
- **Structure**: Each story includes Default, variants, examples, and comprehensive showcases
- **Documentation**: Extract props and examples from existing MDX documentation
- **Approach**: Systematic implementation in phases based on component complexity
- **Organization**: Related components grouped in shared folders (e.g., Button folder, Tags folder)
- **Animations**: Disabled chart animations in Storybook to prevent distracting effects

## Recent Accomplishments
1. âœ… **Tags Component Complete**: Implemented comprehensive Tag story with all variants, colors, sizes, shapes, icons, and interactive examples
2. âœ… **SplitTag Component Complete**: Created SplitTag story with primary/secondary combinations, interactive examples, and real-world use cases
3. âœ… **Folder Organization**: Organized both Tag and SplitTag in shared Tags folder with proper title structure
4. âœ… **Progress Update**: 21 of 34 components completed (62%), working on both Phase 4 & 5 simultaneously

## Next Steps
1. Continue with remaining Phase 4 complex components
2. Continue with remaining Phase 5 specialized components
3. Focus on DataTable, Menu, Dropdown, Sidebar, Directory (Phase 4)
4. Focus on AvatarGroup, Snackbar, StatCard, GradientBlur (Phase 5)

## Resources Available
- âœ… Existing Button.stories.tsx pattern
- âœ… Component MDX documentation in `apps/docs/content/docs/components/`
- âœ… Component meta information and prop tables
- âœ… Working Storybook configuration
- âœ… Component exports available in `blend-v1` package
- âœ… Charts story as reference for complex data visualization components
- âœ… Tags folder as reference for organizing related components

## Constraints
- Must maintain consistency with existing Button story pattern
- Must extract accurate prop information from documentation
- Must ensure all stories are functional and properly tested
- Must follow TypeScript best practices and proper imports
- Must consider performance implications (e.g., disabling animations where appropriate)
- Must organize related components in shared folders for better maintainability

## Technical Notes
- **Tags Organization**: Both Tag and SplitTag components organized in `apps/storybook/stories/components/Tags/`
- **SplitTag Implementation**: Automatically applies NO_FILL variant to primary tag and ATTENTIVE variant to secondary tag
- **Interactive Examples**: Both Tags and SplitTag include interactive examples with state management
- **Real-world Use Cases**: Comprehensive examples for e-commerce, monitoring, project management, and more
- **Progress Tracking**: Now working on both Phase 4 and Phase 5 components simultaneously
