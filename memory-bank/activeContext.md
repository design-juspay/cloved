# Active Context: Storybook Implementation

## Current Focus
Working on both Phase 4 complex components and Phase 5 specialized components. Just completed Snackbar component with all variants and interactive examples.

## Immediate Tasks
1. âœ… **Phase 1**: Plan the implementation approach and create task breakdown
2. âœ… **Phase 2**: Implement stories for high-priority components (Alert, Avatar, Checkbox, etc.)
3. âœ… **Phase 3**: Implement stories for form components (Inputs, Select, Radio, Switch, Button variants)
4. ðŸš§ **Phase 4**: Implement stories for complex components (Modal, DataTable, Charts, etc.)
5. ðŸš§ **Phase 5**: Implement stories for specialized components (Tags, SplitTag, AvatarGroup, etc.)

## Current Decisions
- **Pattern**: Use established story patterns with comprehensive examples
- **Structure**: Each story includes Default, variants, examples, and comprehensive showcases
- **Documentation**: Extract props and examples from existing MDX documentation
- **Approach**: Systematic implementation in phases based on component complexity
- **Organization**: Related components grouped in shared folders (e.g., Button folder, Tags folder)
- **Animations**: Disabled chart animations in Storybook to prevent distracting effects
- **Button Props**: Use `text` and `leadingIcon` props for Button component (not `children` or `leftIcon`)

## Recent Accomplishments
1. âœ… **Snackbar Component Complete**: Implemented comprehensive Snackbar story with all variants (Info, Success, Warning, Error), action buttons, close callbacks, multiple stacking, and real-world examples
2. âœ… **Button Integration**: Updated all trigger buttons with descriptive text using `text` prop and relevant icons using `leadingIcon` prop
3. âœ… **UI Refinements**: Adjusted container height to prevent scrolling, maintained component's internal padding from design tokens
4. âœ… **Progress Update**: 22 of 34 components completed (65%), working on both Phase 4 & 5 simultaneously

## Next Steps
1. Continue with remaining Phase 4 complex components
2. Continue with remaining Phase 5 specialized components
3. Focus on DataTable, Menu, Dropdown, Sidebar, Directory (Phase 4)
4. Focus on AvatarGroup, StatCard, GradientBlur (Phase 5)

## Resources Available
- âœ… Existing Button.stories.tsx pattern
- âœ… Component MDX documentation in `apps/docs/content/docs/components/`
- âœ… Component meta information and prop tables
- âœ… Working Storybook configuration
- âœ… Component exports available in `blend-v1` package
- âœ… Charts story as reference for complex data visualization components
- âœ… Tags folder as reference for organizing related components
- âœ… Snackbar implementation as reference for toast notifications

## Constraints
- Must maintain consistency with existing Button story pattern
- Must extract accurate prop information from documentation
- Must ensure all stories are functional and properly tested
- Must follow TypeScript best practices and proper imports
- Must consider performance implications (e.g., disabling animations where appropriate)
- Must organize related components in shared folders for better maintainability
- Must use correct Button props (`text`, `leadingIcon`) not legacy props

## Technical Notes
- **Snackbar Implementation**: Uses `addSnackbar` function to trigger notifications, component provides internal styling through design tokens
- **Button Props**: Button component expects `text` prop for label and `leadingIcon` prop for icons (pass component reference, not JSX)
- **Container Styling**: Story decorators provide layout containers, but component styling comes from internal tokens
- **Progress Tracking**: Now at 65% completion with 22 components done, 10 remaining
- **Phase Status**: Both Phase 4 and Phase 5 are in progress simultaneously
